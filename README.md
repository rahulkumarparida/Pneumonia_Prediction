# Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

This project is a **beginner-level AI model** trained on a small dataset of **Chest X-Ray Images** to detect signs of pneumonia.  
It serves as a **quick preliminary tool** for doctors to get an overview in high-patient or large-crowd situations, but **it is not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis**.

## âš  Disclaimer
This model is an early-stage, beginner-level AI trained on a small dataset of chest X-ray images. It works by detecting white spots in the chest area that may indicate pneumonia, which creates a baseline for doctors.  
If you upload images that are **not chest X-rays**, the results may be inaccurate or unpredictable.  
Always consult a qualified doctor for confirmation and treatment.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Flow

1. **Dataset Collection**  
   - Dataset used: [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
   - Data preprocessing & augmentation applied for better generalization.

2. **Model Architecture**  
   - Transfer Learning using pre-trained CNN (e.g., MobileNetV2 / EfficientNet).
   - Custom dense layers for classification.

3. **Training**  
   - Used TensorFlow/Keras with data augmentation.
   - Evaluated with validation and test datasets.

4. **Frontend Integration (Optional)**  
   - Built a simple UI to upload images and view predictions in real-time.
   - Model loaded in browser using `TensorFlow.js`.
